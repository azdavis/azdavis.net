        h2 DESCRIPTION
        .indent
            p.
                Ariel Davis is a young man living in the United States. He
                studies Computer Science™ at Carnegie Mellon®. He wrote the
                source for this website and is a fan of such symbols as ™, ®,
                and ©.
            p.
                Ariel spends most of his time browsing Hacker News™ and other
                news websites. When he's not doing that, he may work on
                whatever ephemeral and pointless personal project he's
                concerning himself with.
            p.
                Ariel enjoys activities like sportdisc (known to many as
                Frisbee®) and copy-pasting from Stack Overflow™ (know to many
                as programming). He is low-key attempting to learn 日本語 (known
                to many as Japanese).
