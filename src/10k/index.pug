            Avoiding website bloat
        p.
            As our devices get faster and better, and web standards and
            technologies improve, so too do the websites we visit.
        p.
            â€¦By some measures. Certainly, it has never before been possible to
            create web experiences with such interactivity and depth. Yet,
            websites have also never before been as bloated with distracting
            ads, huge images, and invasive tracking scripts and cookies.
        p.
            Much has been said on this website obesity crisis. Major tech
            companies have brought their proposed solutions
            (#[a(href=amp) one], #[a(href=ins) two]) to the table. Designers
            have expressed their frustration with "heavy" websites
            (#[a(href=woc) one], #[a(href=mw) two], #[a(href=bmw) three]).
            Competitions have been created to encourage the practice of
            reducing website size as much as possible (#[a(href=c5k) one],
            #[a(href=c10k) two]).
        p.
            How, then, can one craft a website, while making sure it is as
            small as possible and loads as quickly as possible?

            Programming and markup languages allow whitespace characters like
            the space and tab to be present in source files. Often, such
            whitespace exists for the sole purpose of improving readability of
            the source by humans, and carries no semantic value.
