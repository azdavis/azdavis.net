            h2 DESCRIPTION
            div
                p.
                    azdavis is a guy from the United States. He studies
                    computer science at Carnegie Mellon®. He created this site
                    and is a fan of symbols such as ™, ®, and ©.
                p.
                    azdavis spends most of his time browsing Hacker News™ and
                    other news sites. When he's not doing that, he may work on
                    his personal computer-science-y project du jour, read a
                    book, or fruitlessly attempt to learn the Japanese
                    language.
                p.
                    azdavis enjoys certain enjoyable activities, that among
                    these are tossing a Sportdisc™ (known to many as a
                    Frisbee®), playing Klaus Teuber's Catan® (known to many as
                    Settlers of Catan®), and copy-pasting from Stack Overflow™
                    (known to many as the act of programming).
