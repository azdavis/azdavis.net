title: Resources for learning Japanese

I enjoy studying the Japanese language and culture. Over time I've found lots of
helpful resources that I use to study.

## Jisho

[Website](https://jisho.org)

Standard Japanese-English dictionary. The other direction works too. Clean,
simple interface, good content.

## Tofugu: Learn the Kana

- [Hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)
- [Katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/)

Japanese has 3 different writing systems. Luckily, the first 2, hiragana and
katakana, collectively 'the kana', are pretty small and 'match up' with one
another, in that each has the same number of characters and make the same
sounds. How to read the kana should definitely be the first thing to get squared
away.

## Guide to Japanese

[Website](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/)

Good as a grammar reference. Topics are basically ordered with more
basic/fundamental ones starting first and more niche ones as it goes on. I've
read everything in 'The writing system', 'Basic grammar', 'Essential grammar',
and 'Special expressions' but haven't even bothered with everything in 'Advanced
topics' since they're so niche.

It has some exercises for earlier topics and all topics, even advanced ones,
have example sentences and explanations in English.

I like this one because it doesn't just try to answer the question 'How do I say
this common thing from English' necessarily. It instead teaches Japanese grammar
from the foundations.

A good example of the difference between this approach and the 'usual' approach
is how the 'regular' and 'polite' forms are taught with each approach.

In Japanese, there is a 'regular' form and a 'polite' form of verbs. Most
textbooks/resources will start by teaching the polite form, because this form is
a good 'default' to use when talking to practically anyone.

But then, when they later teach you the regular form, you realize that actually
the regular form is the true, 'base' form of words/the grammar, and the polite
form is derived from it.

This guide instead first teaches the regular form and later tells you how to
derive the polite form from it.

## WaniKani

[Website](https://www.wanikani.com/)

Teaches you 'radicals', kanji, and words. Past the first 2 levels it requires a
subscription/lifetime purchase. I did the latter and it set me back a few
hundred dollars (200? 300?) but honestly i think it was worth it for me.

Even if you don't want to pay for WaniKani, it is important to understand that
if you want to read/write Japanese at all, you will have to learn a decent
number of kanji. And the most important thing to know when learning kanji,
whether using WaniKani or not, is this:

Unlike in English with the alphabet, the 'character' is _not_ the smallest unit
of the writing system. Rather, the smallest unit is the 'radical'.

I used to not know this, and I'd try to learn kanji like e.g. 議 'as a unit'.
Now, when learning a kanji, you generally have to learn

- How to write it with the correct stroke order (maybe you don't care about this
  if you only want to read, but I wanted to write too)
- How to pronounce it (the 'reading')
- What it generally means (the meaning)

For _every one of these things_, using radicals makes things _far_ easier. For
the example 議 we have that

- It has 20 strokes
- It's usually pronounced ぎ (gi)
- It means 'deliberation' or 'discussion'

At one time, the way I tried to learn kanji like this was just to hard-memorize
all of these things. But once I knew radicals, I realized this character is just
_2 radicals_: 言 and 義.

- To write 議, I literally just write a small 言 and then write a small 義 next
  to it
- 言 means 'say' which is kind of related to 'deliberation'
- 義 is also pronounced ぎ (gi)

Now, some kanji fall into the cute category of 'kind of looks like a picture':

- 木 looks like a tree and it means tree!
- 林 is 'forest'!
- 森 is 'woods'!

But actually [very many kanji][phono-semantic] are like 議, in that they're
composed of 2 radicals, one of which gives a hint to the meaning and the other a
hint to the reading.

Bottom line: learn radicals. There's an [article][kanji-mistakes] about it.

## NHK News Web Easy

[Website](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/)

'Easy' japanese news about current events. Pretty short articles. Good for
reading practice. You can also listen to some (all?) of the articles and toggle
the reading hints ('furigana') for kanji for more practice.

## YouTube

There's a ton of Japanese YouTubers out there, but here are a few that I watch
from time to time:

- [Mina Luna Japanese][mina-luna]
- [あかね的日本語教室][akane]
- [日本語の森][mori]

The above channels are mainly focused on Japanese education, but it can also be
helpful to find channels in the Japanese language but not specifically about
teaching Japanese, like [Nakata University][nakata].
