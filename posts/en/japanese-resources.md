I enjoy studying the Japanese language and culture. Over time I've found lots of
helpful resources that I use to study.

## Jisho

[Website](https://jisho.org)

Standard Japanese-English dictionary. The other direction works too. Simple
interface, good content.

## Tofugu: Learn the Kana

- [Hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)
- [Katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/)

Japanese has 3 different writing systems. The first 2, hiragana and katakana,
are called the kana. These each have 46 characters, which correspond to each
other, in that they both make the same sounds. For example, the Hiragana
character あ and the Katakana character ア both make the sound "ah".

How to read the kana should definitely be the first thing to learn.

## Guide to Japanese

[Website](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/)

Good as a grammar reference. Topics are basically ordered with more
basic/fundamental ones first and more niche ones later.

It has some exercises for earlier topics and all topics, even advanced ones,
have example sentences and explanations in English.

I like this resource because it doesn't just try to answer the question "How do
I say this common thing from English" necessarily. It instead teaches Japanese
grammar from the foundations.

A good example of the difference between this approach and the usual approach is
how the regular and polite forms are taught with each approach.

In Japanese, there is a regular form and a polite form of verbs. Most
textbooks/resources will start by teaching the polite form, because this form is
a good default to use when talking to practically anyone.

But then, when they later teach you the regular form, you realize that the
regular form is the base form, and the polite form is derived from it.

This guide instead first teaches the regular form and later tells you how to
derive the polite form from it.

## WaniKani

[Website](https://www.wanikani.com/)

Teaches you "radicals", kanji, and words. Past the first 2 levels it requires a
subscription or a lifetime purchase.

Even if you don't want to pay for WaniKani, it is important to understand that
if you want to read or write Japanese at all, you will have to learn a decent
number of kanji. And the most important thing to know when learning kanji,
whether using WaniKani or not, is this:

Unlike in English with the alphabet, the character is not the smallest unit
of the writing system. Rather, the smallest unit is the "radical".

I used to not know this, and I therefore struggled with learning kanji. When
learning a single kanji character, you generally have to learn

- How to write it with the correct stroke order
- How to pronounce it (the reading)
- What it generally means (the meaning)

For example, take 議.

- It has 20 strokes.
- It's usually pronounced ぎ (gi).
- It means "deliberation" or "discussion".

This character is composed of 2 radicals: 言 and 義. Knowing the radicals
helps with every aspect of a kanji:

- To write 議, I literally just write a small 言 and then write a small 義 next
  to it.
- 義 is also pronounced ぎ (gi).
- 言 means "say" which is kind of related to "deliberation".

Now, some kanji are pictograms, which means they kind of look like a picture:

- 木 looks like a tree, and it means "tree".
- 林 is two trees, and it means "forest".
- 森 is three trees, and it means "woods".
- 大 kind of looks like a big guy stretching his arms out, and it means "big".

But actually most kanji, like 議, are [phono-semantic
compounds][phono-semantic]. This means they're composed of 2 radicals, one of
which gives a hint to the meaning and the other a hint to the reading.

Bottom line: learn radicals. There's an [article][kanji-mistakes] about it.

## NHK News Web Easy

[Website](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/)

Japanese language news about current events. Pretty short articles. Good for
reading practice. You can also listen to some of the articles and toggle off the
reading hints ("furigana") for more practice.

## YouTube

There's a ton of Japanese YouTubers out there, but I sometimes watch [Mina Luna
Japanese][mina-luna] and [Nakata University][nakata].

It's good to have a mix of channels focused on Japanese education, and channels
which just happen to be in Japanese. The education ones teach specifically about
different grammar points, wheras the non-education focused ones often have a
faster and more realistic rate of speech, as well as more spoken colloquialisms.
