When I write, I can sense on some level that my writing is not the best. Even after editing, I feel it could be improved somehow, but I'm not sure how.

I suspect, and hope, that if I become better at writing, I will look back on old posts and be able to point out exactly what is wrong, but this skill is currently beyond me.

Writing these posts is an avenue to improve my writing. As with most things, to get better, I must put in the practice.
