Here's a question:

> Are some people inherently superior to others?

This question, if answered honestly, says a lot about a person's overall worldview.

Most people, even if they actually believed the answer is yes, would probably answer no. Because the obvious follow-up to a yes answer is: Which people do you think are superior? And why? In many cases people would rather not, or cannot, acknowledge their prejudices and biases.

Here's another question:

> Should we try to effect change in society, or leave things as they are now?

To answer this question, we should ask: are things the way they are now optimal, or can we improve?

Most people would answer that we can improve. And so it immediately follows that we should try to effect change.

The answers to these questions seem so obvious to me. No, no one is inherently superior or more valuable than another: every life is unique and irreplaceable. No, society is not optimal: we have immense economic and social inequality, political polarization, and general fear and suspicion of one another. Yes, we should try to change society for the better.

It's unfortunate, then, that so many people seem to reject these ideas.

I know, not just from analyzing its policy positions, but also from its core philosophy, that  conservatism is not for me.

Things worth conserving, like [national parks](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-park-firings-doge-grand-teton-baedee0a748a6374eafb6f95aac5dadc), should indeed be preserved and protected. But defaulting to preserving things only because "that is what has been done" is not valid.

You should constantly be challenging, and perhaps updating, your positions and beliefs, by considering new data and viewpoints. Yet to me, conservatism is a tendency to default to, or exclusively demand, a **lack** of change. This seems deeply, fundamentally incorrect. The only constant in our world is change.

I remember a little while ago, I wondering about why sometimes people talk about "conservative" and "liberal", but also about "right-wing" and "left-wing". At the time I understood that right-wing is associated with conservatism and left-wing with liberalism.

I also knew that any leftist will be quick to point out the key difference between liberalism and leftism, which is, in brief, that liberals like capitalism and leftists do not.

So I wondered, is there any difference between right-wing politics and conservatism? I looked up the definition of [right-wing politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics) and found:

> Right-wing politics is the range of political ideologies that view certain social orders and hierarchies as inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable.

The shock I felt when reading this is what mainly drove me to write this post. Here it was, staring me in the face: a fundamental **disagreement** with the idea that we area **all** equally, inherently valuable. As with the tendency to reject change out of hand, I find this viewpoint deeply unappealing.
