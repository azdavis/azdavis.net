The notion of karma comes from Indian religion. It is essentially the idea that doing good things means your life, and future rebirths, will be better, while doing bad things means the opposite.

This idea is not unique to Indian religion. There are many sayings and idioms related to this idea.

- What goes around comes around.
- They got what was coming to them.
- Serves them right.
- Everything happens for a reason.
- All a part of God's plan.
- Just desserts.

I do believe that it's good to do good things - by definition, I suppose. And certainly, doing good things does make me feel good. In that sense, it makes my life better.

But it is naive to think that people always get what they deserve.

It is a comforting notion. The idea that there is some cosmic justice. That crime doesn't pay. That bad people won't get rewarded, and good people will live a life of privilege.

Because it's so comforting, people seem to genuinely believe it is true. But it is demonstrably untrue. It is a fallacy: the [just-world fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_fallacy).

An easy example: babies and young children are too young to have virtually any ability to do anything, good or bad. We would expect in a just world, then, that nothing terrible should ever befall them. And yet they get sick, or are subject to war and devastation, or are abused by their caretakers, or abandoned, or die.

It's bad enough that bad things happen to those who've done nothing wrong. But it's even worse that people who believe in karma thus come to the conclusion that if bad things are happening to you, it's because **you deserve it**.

This breeds an attitude of mistrust, fear, and derision towards those who are less privileged than others - even though they need society's support the most. And in turn, it contributes to idolization of the rich and powerful - even though the powerful often gain their power by exploiting the weak.
