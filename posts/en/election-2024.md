desc: The choice is clear.

In the United States, we have a [first past the post (FPTP) voting system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo). This is why we have only two dominant political parties. Generally, a voter can only express their preference between the choices offered by those two major political parties.

It's frustrating to me that we don't have a better voting system in place, that would allow us to express more nuanced opinions. Systems like [ranked choice voting](https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/) would solve some important problems with FPTP.

However, **given** the system we have, it is **irrational** to **not** express your preference between the choices offered by the two major parties, if you have a preference.

And how could you not, in this case?

There are only two people who might become President in 2025: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Even if you disagree with Harris's proposed policies, **only Harris** believes in [your right to disagree with them](https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DB4aHh4uP8l).

To support Trump would be to fall into the [paradox of tolerance](/posts/moderation). We can't tolerate, we can't elect, a candidate who believes those who disagree with him are "[the enemy within](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/trump-military-enemy-within-armed-forces-election-day)" and who tried to subvert democracy by engaging in [stochastic terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_terrorism) when [he lost last time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack).

I don't usually like broadcasting my opinions like this on the broader Internet. But I feel a need to be clear now: [Donald Trump is unfit to lead](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/02/opinion/vote-harris-2024-election.html). Just [ask his former Cabinet members](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/reich-track-wrong-track):

> Nearly half of Donald Trump's Cabinet have refused to endorse him. When Trump learned during the Capitol riot that his supporters were threatening to kill his own vice president, he said 'so what?' and refused to do anything to assure the vice president was safe. Republican governors, senators, and House members have all said the same thing: We canâ€™t give Trump another four years as president.

It's time to turn the page. Vote Harris.
