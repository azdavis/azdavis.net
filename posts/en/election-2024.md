desc: The choice is clear.

In the United States, we have a [first past the post (FPTP) voting system][fptp]. This is why we have only two dominant political parties.

It's frustrating to me that we don't use a better voting system, like some form of [ranked choice voting][rcv]. This would solve important problems with FPTP, and make "third parties", as they are so called in the US, more of a viable choice.

However, **given** the system we have, it is **irrational** to **not** express your preference between the two choices offered by the major parties, if you have a preference.

And how could you not, in this case?

There are only two people who might become President in 2025: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Even if you disagree with Harris's proposed policies, only Harris believes in [your right to disagree with them][diagree].

To support Trump would be to fall into the [paradox of tolerance][tolerance]. We can't tolerate, we can't elect, a candidate who believes those who disagree with him are "[the enemy within][enemy-within]" and who tried to subvert democracy by engaging in [stochastic terrorism][terror] when [he lost last time][jan6].

I don't usually like broadcasting my opinions like this on the Internet. But I feel a need to be clear now: [Donald Trump is unfit to lead][unfit].

But don't take it from me. Take it from [his former Cabinet members and members of his own party][cabinet]:

> Nearly half of Donald Trump's Cabinet have refused to endorse him. When Trump learned during the Capitol riot that his supporters were threatening to kill his own vice president, he said 'so what?' and refused to do anything to assure the vice president was safe. Republican governors, senators, and House members have all said the same thing: We canâ€™t give Trump another four years as president.

It's time to turn the page. Vote Harris.
