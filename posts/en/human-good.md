Humans are overall good.

It is true that humans are capable of great evil, and we have indeed committed
terrible atrocities against each other and against nature. However, I believe
that most people are good most of the time.

Although the world is by many measures safer and more prosperous than it has
ever been, the news often focuses on "the bad". This is because learning about
"the bad" elicits a strong negative reaction from us, which drives engagement,
aka more clicks and views for the news.

Indeed, I take this as proof of the general goodness of humanity. The fact that
we feel concern and anger in the face of unfairness, injustice, and cruelty
shows that we value fairness, justice, and kindness.

It is easy to ignore "the good" because it is what we expect. It is the default.
It is taken for granted. It does not deserve attention. What deserves attention
is that which is not good, so that we may fix it.
