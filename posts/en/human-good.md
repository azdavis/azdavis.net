The world is, by many measures, safer and more prosperous than it has ever been.
Yet, I find it is common that we forget this, and focus on what is wrong with
the world.

It is easy to ignore what is right and good, because, in some sense, it does not
deserve our attention. What deserves, and gets, our focus is that which is not
right, so that we may fix it.

I consider this to be proof of the general goodness of humanity. That we feel
concern in the face of unfairness, injustice, and cruelty, shows that we value
fairness, justice, and kindness. That we forget what is good, and focus on what
is bad, shows that we expect things to be good, and desire to improve that which
is not.
