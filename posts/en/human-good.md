In many respects, the world is safer and more prosperous than it has ever been.
Yet, I find it is common that we forget this, and focus on what is wrong with
the world.

That which is right and just does not require improvement, so we focus less on
it. We instead focus is that which is not, so that we may fix it.

I consider this to be proof of the general goodness of humanity. That we feel
concern in the face of unfairness, injustice, and cruelty, shows that we value
fairness, justice, and kindness. That we forget what is good, and focus on what
is bad, shows that we expect things to be good, and desire to improve that which
is not.
