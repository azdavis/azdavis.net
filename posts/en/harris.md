In the United States, we have a [first past the post (FPTP) voting system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo). This is why we have only two dominant political parties. Generally, a voter can only express their preference between the choices offered by those two major political parties.

It's frustrating to me that we don't have a better voting system in place, that would allow us to express more nuanced opinions. Systems like [ranked choice voting](https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/) would solve some important problems with FPTP.

However, **given** the system we have, it is **irrational** to **not** express your preference between the choices offered by the two major parties, if you have a preference.

And how could you not, in this case?

There are only two people who might become President in 2025: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Even if you disagree with Harris's proposed policies, only Harris believes in [your right to disagree with them](https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DB4aHh4uP8l). To support Trump would be to fall into the [paradox of tolerance](/posts/moderation). We can't tolerate, we can't elect, a candidate who believes those who disagree with him are "[the enemy within](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/trump-military-enemy-within-armed-forces-election-day)".

I don't usually like broadcasting my opinions like this on the broader Internet. But I feel a need to be clear now: [Donald Trump is unfit to lead](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/02/opinion/vote-harris-2024-election.html). Vote Harris.
