Those who have heard me talk about public policy will know that I often bemoan the dominance of private cars as the primary mode of transport for most Americans. The benefits of well-implemented public transport are real:

- Safer
- Cheaper
- Quieter
- Faster
- More energy efficient
- More space efficient

## It's not about public transport

Curiously enough, I wouldn't describe myself as a fan of public transport per se. Rather, I'd say I'm a fan of _being able to get to my destination_, and I just happen to think private cars are often not the best way to do that.

You see this issue in software engineering as well. Sometimes we forget that the point is not to "write code", but rather to _solve a problem_.

## It's not about hating cars

In a similar vein, I wouldn't say that I hate cars. I find the framing of "[fuck cars][rfuckcars]" to be counterproductive. A car owner might interpret "fuck cars" as "fuck you" and become defensive, shutting down conversation.

It's much rarer to convince someone of your viewpoint with anger and hate, than it is by laying out the facts calmly and respectfully.

## Cars have their place

You'll notice that I said that cars are _often_ not the best way to get around. But of course, cars are useful in some cases, like when traveling through rural areas or with large cargo.

Every developed country that has advanced public transport also has a well-developed system of roads and freeways.

## Hope for the future

Trying to [build a city][xkcd] around cars, however, is basically impossible. Car-centric cities cannot possibly be livable and walkable. The physical reality of how much space cars take up doesn't allow it.

Because of this, I believe over time, cities that want to densify will have no choice but to abandon car-centrism and implement support for other modes of transport.

## Options benefit us all

Moving away from car-centrism and investing in other modes of transport naturally benefits non-drivers, like children and those without a license.

But these policies also benefit car owners, who will enjoy less traffic and roads that break down less rapidly, due to fewer cars using those roads.
