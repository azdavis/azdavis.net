The most important quality in an individual or organization is the desire and ability to improve.

If you don't have this most important quality, no matter how great you currently are, you will never get any better, and never change.

This is why freedom of speech is so important. We must always be able to criticize governments and other organizations, to be able to get them to serve us better.
