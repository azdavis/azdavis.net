title: "Communication for software engineers"

I enjoy practicing my technical skills. However, now that I've graduated from
college and have begun to work in the industry as a software engineer, I've
begun to focus more on communication. Here is some of what I've learned and
continue to try to put into practice.

## Consider your audience

The most important thing when communicating to is to _consider your audience_.
Indeed, the whole point of communication is to share ideas with someone else,
i.e. your audience. The purpose of writing an document is not _to have written
the document_, but rather _to convey information to the reader_.

## Be brief

Distill your communication down to its essence. Say what must be said, and
[nothing more][less].

I find that sometimes I focus too much on specific details. But to communicate
effectively, one must put the most focus on what is most important.

## Use structure

When writing a document, the easier your document is to read, the more likely it
is that your audience will actually read it. Empower a reader to quickly and
effectively get what they want from your document by:

- Splitting up your document into sections with clear headings.
- Using bulleted lists or tables for structured information.
- Keeping the word count low.

## Tie it back to what matters

In the end, a software engineer is employed to engineer software. This means
that it is prudent to define explicit deliverables and milestones in e.g. a
project brief.

## Conclusion

In closing, I would note two things:

- What has been said here has been said before, [and that's ok][unoriginal].
- Some, but not all, of what I've written here applies to other sorts of
  writing.
