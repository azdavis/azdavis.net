It's okay to do things that other people have done before.

I don't claim to be the first one to have thought of any of the things I write
about here. I write about the things that I do because:

- I personally care about those things.
- I want to practice writing.
- Maybe someone reading what I've written can be part of today's [lucky 10,000
  people][lucky] learning about that thing for the first time.
