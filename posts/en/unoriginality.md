It's okay to write about things that other people have written about.

I don't claim to be the first one to have thought of any of the things I write
about here. I write about the things that I do because:

- I personally care about those things.
- I want to practice writing.
- Maybe someone reading what I've written can be part of today's [lucky 10,000
  people][1] learning about that thing for the first time. That is, even if it's
  not a new idea in general, it's a new idea for that person.

We can generalize "write about things" to "do things in general". Which is to
say, don't hesitate to do something just because it's been done before.
