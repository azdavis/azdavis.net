It's okay to do things that other people have done before. This is true even when other people have done that thing better than you are (currently) able.

I don't claim to be the first one to have thought of any of the things I write about here. I write about the things that I do because:

- I personally care about those things.
- I want to practice writing.
- Maybe someone reading what I've written can be part of today's [lucky 10,000][lucky] learning about that thing for the first time.
