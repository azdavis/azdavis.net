# First post

This is the first post. It's basically just testing that the thing I hacked
together to render HTML pages with code syntax highlighting is working.

```rs
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
  let date = vec![2021, 03, 24];
  let posted = true;
  if posted {
    println!("The date is {:?}", date);
  }
}
```
